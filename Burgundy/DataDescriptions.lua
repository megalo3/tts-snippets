Descriptions['Boarding House'] = 'When you place a boarding house in your duchy, immediately gain 4 worker tokens from the supply.'
Descriptions["Carpenter's Workshop"] = "When you place a carpenter's workshop in your duchy, you may immediately take a beige building tile from any of the six depots on the game board (except the central black depot) and place it on an empty key space in the bottom right of your player board."
Descriptions['Castle'] = 'Whenever you place a castle tile in your duchy, you immediately take an additional action, just as if you had another die with your choice of result at your disposal.'
Descriptions['Church'] = 'When you place a church in your duchy, you may immediately take a mine (gray), monastery (yellow), or castle (burgundy) tile from any of the six depots on the game board (except the central black depot) and place it on an empty key space in the bottom right of your player board.'
Descriptions['Crane'] = 'When you place a crane in your duchy, you may immediately trigger the effect of any building (beige) tile you want, even if that building is not in your duchy.\n\nFor example, you could sell goods (warehouse), or gain 2 silver coins (bank), or take a castle tile from the game board (church), etc.\n\n Additionally, during final scoring at the end of the game, the crane counts as a building of your choice for the corresponding monastery tiles (16-23 + 29).\n\nThis may be a different building from the one you triggered when placing the crane.'
Descriptions['Geese'] = 'When you place the two geese in your duchy, you score 2 victory points as normal, plus victory points for one other type of livestock that is in the same pasture. Later, whenever you place another livestock tile in the same pasture, you score 2 victory points for the geese tile. In addition, geese count as additional type of livestock for monastery tiles #7 and #24.\n\nExample: Carla places the geese tile on a pasture that already has a 2 and a 3 cow tile. Carla scores 2+2+3 = 7 victory points. During a later turn, she places a 4 pig tile in the same pasture and scores 4+2 = 6 victory points.'
Descriptions['Inn'] = "At the beginning of each phase, place one inn on the indicated space next to the central black depot. Unlike other hex tiles, inns are not removed from the board at the end of each phase. If there is already an inn next to the central black depot, stack the new one on top.\n\nLike every other hex tile from the black depot, inns may be bought by paying 2 silver coins, and placed on a key space on the player's board.\n\nAn inn may be placed on any empty hex space on your duchy (according to the regular rules). However, you may only place up to one inn per color area!\n\nThe inn itself has no effect, its only function is to complete an area.\n\nImportant: By placing an inn, you increase the size of that area by 1. A 9-space area scores 45 victory points."
Descriptions['Livestock'] = 'Whenever you place a livestock tile in your duchy, you immediately score victory points. Each tile shows 2-4 livestock, which is the amount of victory points you score.\n\nAdditionally, if you already have at least one other tile with the same livestock in the same pasture (a contiguous area of green hex spaces), you also score victory points for those other tiles.'

Descriptions['Monastery 7'] = 'Whenever you place a livestock tile, in addition to the usual bonus for existing livestock of the same type in the same pasture, you also score 1 victory point for each livestock tile that scores at that time.\n\nExample: Ben places a 3 sheep tile on the pasture that already contains a 4 sheep tile: He gains (3+1) + (4+1) = 9 victory points. If he places a 2 pig tile, he gets 3 victory points.'
Descriptions['Monastery 8'] = 'Whenever you use a worker to change the result of a die, you may add or subtract 2 instead of 1.\n\nExample: To change a 3 to a 6, Carla only needs to use 2 workers instead of 3.'
